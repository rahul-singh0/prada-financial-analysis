# Prada Financial Analysis 2013-2023
<h3>Objective</h3>
Prada, a renowed luxury fashion house, is known for its high-end clothing, leather goods, and accessories. This project aimed to analyse Prada's financial performance over the past decade, focusing on key metrics scuh as revenue, profit, and regional performance. By using tools such as PostgreSQL, Python, and Tableau, the project uncovers insights that reveal which regions, brands, and products drove growth, and provides recommendations for future business strategies.

<h3>Deliverables</h3>

- Comprehensive analysis of financial data from 2013-2023.
- Interactive visualisations in Tableau showcasing key financial metrics, including revenue, profit, brand performance, and regional breakdowns.
- Key insights and data-driven recommendations to guide future strategies for growth.

<h3>Tools and Technologies Used</h3>

- <b>PostgreSQL</b> for data storage and querying.
- <b>Python</b> for data processing, cleaning, and analysis.
- <b>Tableau</b> for data visualisation and dashboard creation.
- <b>Excel</b> for inital data exploration and validation.

<h2>Project Workflow</h2>
<h3>1. Define Scope and Metrics</h3>

The scope of the project focused on analysis financial perofrmance data, with the primary metrics including
- Total revenue.
- Net income.
- EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization).
- Regional and brand revenue breakdown.
- Year-on-year growth in key metrics.

<h3>2. Data collection and Database Setup</h3>
To begin the project, I sourced Prada’s annual financial reports from 2013 to 2023. These reports provided the key data on financial performance, including revenue, profit, EBITDA, and regional contributions.

<h4>Data Extraction:</h4>
To streamline the extraction of key financial metrics from these reports, I utilised ChatGPT to gather and summarise critical figures such as total revenue, net income, EBITDA, and other relevant KPIs from each year’s report. This allowed for a more efficient extraction process across the 10-year period.

<h4>Data Organisation:</h4>

Once the data was collected, I organised it into separate tables using Excel, ensuring that each table represented a distinct aspect of Prada’s financial performance:
- <b>Financial Metrics:</b> Containing total revenue, EBITDA, net income, gross margin, EBIT, and total number of stores.
- <b>Brand Revenue:</b> Tracking revenue generated by Prada’s key brands: Prada, Miu Miu, and Church’s.
- <b>Product Revenue:</b> Categorising revenue based on product categories such as clothing, footwear, and leather goods.
- <b>Regional Revenue:</b> Displaying revenue by geographic regions including Americas, Asia Pacific, Europe, Japan, and the Middle East.
- <b>Sales Contribution:</b> Dividing sales into retail and wholesale percentages.

Once the tables were structured, I saved them in CSV format for further analysis using Python, SQL, and Tableau. The following entity relationship diagram (ERD) was created to represent the relationships between the tables and facilitate efficient querying.
