<h1>Project Workflow</h1>
<h2>1. Define Scope and Metrics</h2>

The scope of the project focused on analysis financial perofrmance data, with the primary metrics including
- Total revenue.
- Net income.
- EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization).
- Regional and brand revenue breakdown.
- Year-on-year growth in key metrics.

<h2>2. Data collection and Database Setup</h2>
To begin the project, I sourced Prada’s annual financial reports from 2013 to 2023. These reports provided the key data on financial performance, including revenue, profit, EBITDA, and regional contributions.

<h3>Data Extraction:</h3>
To streamline the extraction of key financial metrics from these reports, I utilised ChatGPT to gather and summarise critical figures such as total revenue, net income, EBITDA, and other relevant KPIs from each year’s report. This allowed for a more efficient extraction process across the 10-year period.

<h3>Data Organisation:</h3>

Once the data was collected, I organised it into separate tables using Excel, ensuring that each table represented a distinct aspect of Prada’s financial performance:
- <b>Financial Metrics:</b> Containing total revenue, EBITDA, net income, gross margin, EBIT, and total number of stores.
- <b>Brand Revenue:</b> Tracking revenue generated by Prada’s key brands: Prada, Miu Miu, and Church’s.
- <b>Product Revenue:</b> Categorising revenue based on product categories such as clothing, footwear, and leather goods.
- <b>Regional Revenue:</b> Displaying revenue by geographic regions including Americas, Asia Pacific, Europe, Japan, and the Middle East.
- <b>Sales Contribution:</b> Dividing sales into retail and wholesale percentages.

Once the tables were structured, I saved them in CSV format for further analysis using Python, SQL, and Tableau.

This diagram showcases how the data tables are linked, with financial metrics serving as the primary data source, and supporting tables for brands, products, and regions.

<h3>Database and Table Creation</h3>

```sql 
CREATE DATABASE prada_financial_data;
```

```sql 
CREATE TABLE financial_metrics (
    year INT PRIMARY KEY,
    total_revenue_million_euro DECIMAL(10,2),
    ebitda_million_euro DECIMAL(10,2),
    net_income_million_euro DECIMAL(10,2),
    gross_margin_percent DECIMAL(5,2),
    ebit_million_euro DECIMAL(10,2),
    ebitda_margin_percent DECIMAL(5,2),
    total_stores INT
);

CREATE TABLE regional_revenue (
    year INT,
    region VARCHAR(50),
    revenue_million_euro DECIMAL(10,2),
    PRIMARY KEY (year, region),
    FOREIGN KEY (year) REFERENCES financial_metrics(year)
);

CREATE TABLE product_revenue (
    year INT,
    product_category VARCHAR(50),
    revenue_million_euro DECIMAL(10,2),
    PRIMARY KEY (year, product_category),
    FOREIGN KEY (year) REFERENCES financial_metrics(year)
);

CREATE TABLE brand_revenue (
    year INT,
    brand VARCHAR(50),
    revenue_million_euro DECIMAL(10,2),
    PRIMARY KEY (year, brand),
    FOREIGN KEY (year) REFERENCES financial_metrics(year)
);

CREATE TABLE sales_contribution (
    year INT PRIMARY KEY,
    retail_sales_percent DECIMAL(5,2),
    wholesale_sales_percent DECIMAL(5,2),
    FOREIGN KEY (year) REFERENCES financial_metrics(year)
);
```

```sql 
COPY financial_metrics FROM '/Users/rahul/Documents/Analyst/Projects/Prada Financial Analysis/Annual Reports/Tables/csv/financial_metrics.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;

COPY regional_revenue FROM '/Users/rahul/Documents/Analyst/Projects/Prada Financial Analysis/Annual Reports/Tables/csv/regional_revenue.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;

COPY product_revenue FROM '/Users/rahul/Documents/Analyst/Projects/Prada Financial Analysis/Annual Reports/Tables/csv/product_revenue.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;

COPY brand_revenue FROM '/Users/rahul/Documents/Analyst/Projects/Prada Financial Analysis/Annual Reports/Tables/csv/brand_revenue.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;

COPY sales_contribution FROM '/Users/rahul/Documents/Analyst/Projects/Prada Financial Analysis/Annual Reports/Tables/csv/sales_contribution.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;
```

<h2>3. Data Cleaning and Preparation with SQL and Python</h2>

Once the database was set up with the relevant tables, the next step was to clean and prepare the data for analysis. During data collection, the accuracy of the financial reports was verified before manually entering the key metrics into the tables. After entering the data into the PostgreSQL database, the data was further validated by checking for missing values, ensuring consistency across datasets, and verifying that all expected entries were present for the specified years (2013-2023).

<h3>Loading the Data into PostgreSQL:</h3>

- CSV files were loaded into the respective tables within the PostgreSQL database using the COPY command to populate each table with the relevant data from the annual reports.

<h3>Python Connection to PostgreSQL:</h3>

- Using psycopg2, a connection was established to the PostgreSQL database from Python. This allowed data to be queried directly into pandas DataFrames for further cleaning and analysis.
```python 
import psycopg2
conn = psycopg2.connect(
    host="localhost",
    database="prada_financial_data",
    user="rahul"
)
```

<h3>Querying Data from Multiple Tables:</h3>

- SQL queries were written to fetch data from multiple tables. Each query was executed, and the results were loaded into individual pandas DataFrames for further processing.
- Example query:
```python 
query_financial = "SELECT * FROM financial_metrics"
df_financial = pd.read_sql(query_financial, conn)
```

<h3>Checking for Missing Values:</h3>

- After loading the data into pandas, the first step in cleaning was to identify any missing values across all tables. The .isnull().sum() function was used to count the missing values in each column.
- Example:
```python 
print(df_financial.isnull().sum())
```
![is_null_sum](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4552c4be-51af-4a28-b496-96729c3b158e)

<h3>Ensuring Data Completeness:</h3>

- The data was checked to ensure that all expected years (2013-2023) were present across all tables. This was a critical step to guarantee consistency across the various datasets.
- Example:
```python 
print(df_financial['year'].unique())
```
![year_unique](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e071221c-5c7c-4881-b1c0-348ba84c4376)

<h3>Data Type Consistency:</h3>

- The .info() method was used to verify that the data types of each column were correct and suitable for analysis. This included ensuring that numerical columns were in the correct decimal format and categorical columns were strings.
- Example:
```python 
print(df_financial.info())
```
![table_info](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0f9bda4-eef5-4f99-944b-01970ba741e1)

Through these steps, the data was cleaned, validated, and prepared for analysis, ensuring that it was ready for use in the subsequent stages of the project, including analysis and visualisation in Tableau.

<h2>4. Exploratory Data Analysis with SQL and Python</h2>

The exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted using SQL to extract key financial data from the database and Python (pandas and matplotlib) to visualise the insights. This section outlines how the data was extracted, analysed, and summarised to understand Prada’s financial performance from 2013 to 2023.

<h3>SQL Queries for Data Extraction</h3>

To gather data from the PostgreSQL database, I wrote and executed various SQL queries to extract key metrics related to revenue, EBITDA, brand performance, product categories, and more.

- Example - Track year-on-year growth for total revenue and EBITDA:
```sql 
WITH revenue_ebitda_growth AS (
  SELECT year, total_revenue_million_euro, 
         LAG(total_revenue_million_euro) OVER (ORDER BY year) AS prev_year_revenue,
         ebitda_million_euro,
         LAG(ebitda_million_euro) OVER (ORDER BY year) AS prev_year_ebitda
  FROM financial_metrics
)
SELECT year,
       ROUND((total_revenue_million_euro - prev_year_revenue) / prev_year_revenue * 100, 2) AS yoy_revenue_growth,
       ROUND((ebitda_million_euro - prev_year_ebitda) / prev_year_ebitda * 100, 2) AS yoy_ebitda_growth
FROM revenue_ebitda_growth
WHERE prev_year_revenue IS NOT NULL;
```
<h3>Data Analysis and Visualisation in Python</h3>

After extracting the data, I used Python’s matplotlib library to generate a variety of charts that visualised the insights. The charts included line graphs, stacked bar charts, and area charts to analyse trends in various key metrics. I leveraged pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib for visualisation, enabling a clear representation of the financial trends and insights.

An example Python code used to generate regional revenue performance as a stacked area chart:
```python 
# Plot Regional Revenue Performance (Stacked Area Plot)
df_regional_pivot.plot(kind='area', stacked=True, figsize=(10, 6))
plt.title('Regional Revenue Performance Over Time')
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Revenue (Million €)')
plt.legend(title='Region')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

<h3>Key Findings from the Analysis</h3>

- <b>Revenue Recovery and Brand Performance:</b> Despite a significant revenue and EBITDA dip in 2020, both recovered strongly in 2021. Prada dominated brand revenue, with leather goods contributing the most across all product categories.
- <b>Regional and Sales Insights:</b> Europe and Asia Pacific were the highest revenue-generating regions, while retail sales consistently made up a larger share of revenue compared to wholesale.
- <b>Store Efficiency:</b> Although the number of stores slightly decreased after 2019, revenue per store saw significant growth, particularly in 2021 and 2022, indicating improved store efficiency.

<h2>5. Data Visualisation in Tableau</h2>
    
In Tableau, I created several charts and a dashboard showcasing Prada’s financial performance from 2013 to 2023. The dashboard features visualisations of revenue, EBITDA, net income trends, brand performance, and a regional revenue breakdown, with a region filter applied specifically to the regional chart for detailed analysis.

<h1>Key Insights and Recommendations</h1>

The analysis of Prada’s financial data (2013-2023) revealed several important insights and strategic recommendations:

- <b>Revenue Recovery:</b> Prada’s revenue rebounded significantly after the 2020 pandemic-related dip, with the Asia Pacific region leading this recovery. To capitalise on this growth, it is recommended that Prada prioritise further investment in high-growth regions, particularly China, through both physical store expansion and strengthened e-commerce efforts.
- <b>Profitability Trends:</b> Profitability improved steadily in recent years, driven by stronger margins and cost control. Prada should continue optimising its store network by closing underperforming locations and transitioning to more digitally integrated, smaller retail spaces to boost overall profitability.
- <b>Brand Performance:</b> While Prada remained the dominant brand, Miu Miu showed notable growth. It is recommended that Prada further invest in Miu Miu by expanding its product offerings and enhancing its marketing to target new customer segments.
- <b>Regional Insights:</b> Europe and Asia Pacific remained the strongest regions, while the Americas grew at a slower pace, and the Middle East saw consistent improvement. Prada should continue to enhance its presence in these regions, particularly by bolstering its e-commerce capabilities in the Middle East to tap into the emerging digital market.
- <b>Product Category Focus:</b> Leather goods consistently contributed the most to revenue. Prada can further optimise its inventory by focusing on high-demand categories, reducing waste, and increasing profitability through better inventory management.

By aligning its strategy with these insights, Prada can ensure sustained growth, enhanced profitability, and continued market leadership across regions and brands.

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

The Prada Financial Analysis (2013-2023) provided valuable insights into the company’s financial performance, highlighting key trends in revenue growth, brand performance, and regional differences. Despite challenges such as incomplete early data and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the analysis identified strategic areas for Prada’s growth, including focusing on high-growth regions like Asia Pacific, enhancing e-commerce, and optimising its store network.

Key learnings from the project emphasised the importance of region-specific strategies and the value of data visualisation in uncovering actionable insights. These findings offer clear recommendations to help Prada maintain profitability and drive future expansion.
